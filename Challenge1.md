# Challenge 1

I chose to pick low income Americans as my users of interest for this activity. 
One task that they perform frequently is cashing checks. Most low income Americans work hourly jobs that pay out in biweekly checks. 
For various reasons, including expensive fees, high minimum deposits, and lack of availabilty in low income areas, traditional banking 
is out of reach for many people. Instead, they chose to cash out their checks using some type of check cashing service. This has many of
its own problems, but is often a simpler option. This task could cause many problems, such as higher fees, or preying behavior where
check cashing institutions setup in lower income areas to target people. 

Looking online, I found many articles and videos containing interviews with people who used these services on a regular basis. Many
had complaints about the fees and lack of financial power it gave them. In the modern day, a bank account is required for many things
such as applying for credit cards or loans. Without access to bank accounts, and check cashing as the only option, this task definitely 
affects many Americans. 

## Problem Statement

Low income Americans are forced to use cash checking services because traditional banking is too expensive, which leads to higher costs and lower access to other financial services.
